# Data Analyst
Hello, I am Mildred Mawuena Tseh, a detail-oriented Data Analyst who loves exploring data, uncovering patterns, and building insightful visualizations that translate complex datasets into actionable insights. With expertise in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, I specialize in data analysis, visualization, and reporting, helping businesses and teams make informed, strategic decisions.

I'm passionate about collaborating with clients who value data-driven decision-making and need expert analysis to uncover trends, optimize processes, and drive growth. Whether it is building interactive dashboards, automating data workflows, or extracting key insights from complex datasets, I thrive on delivering impactful solutions.

#### ðŸ“Š What I Do:

#### Data Cleaning
- With hands on experience in tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, I specialize in handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and performing feature engineering using Pandas, NumPy, and SQL. My goal is to ensure that every dataset is accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready, minimizing errors and improving reliability.

#### Visualization and Storytelling
- A great visualization does more than just present numbers, it tells a story. My work on projects like Water Quality Analysis has equipped me with the skills in creating compelling, interactive dashboards in Power BI, and Excel, using the right charts, colors, and layouts to enhance understanding. Whether it's tracking business performance, monitoring trends, or comparing KPIs, I ensure that every visualization is clear, insightful, and tailored to the audienceâ€™s needs.

#### Report Writing and Documentation
- Crafting clear, data-driven reports that translate complex findings into actionable insights, I focus on structuring reports to highlight key trends, provide strategic recommendations, and communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.
